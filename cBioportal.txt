NAVIGATING cBioPortal

I navigated the portal,there are different datasets containing samples per cancer study and data type uploaded

I also noted API use where we can use R and python to access data from the portal

I also noted tools oncoprinter which enables one generate oncoprints and perform mutual exclusivity analysis on data,    
 Mutation mapper which interpretes mutations with protein annotations
